Behavioral data description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Emotional expression                | View face and label emotion expressed  |
|                                     | (happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust,     |
|                                     | surprise) where faces are morphs along |
|                                     | axes between emotional expression.     |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Emotional memory                    | Study: View (positive, neutral, or     |
|                                     | negative) background image, then object|
|                                     | image superimposed, and imagine a      |
|                                     | 'story' linking the two; Test          |
|                                     | (incidental): View and identify        |
|                                     | degraded image of (studied, new)       |
|                                     | object, then judge memory and          |
|                                     | confidence for visually intact image   |
|                                     | of same object, then recall valence    |
|                                     | and any details of background image    |
|                                     | from study phase.                      |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Emotional reactivity and regulation | View (positive, neutral, negative)     |
|                                     | film clips under instructions to       |
|                                     | simply 'watch' or 'reappraise'         |
|                                     | (attempt to reduce emotional impact by |
|                                     | reinterpreting its meaning; for some   |
|                                     | negative films only), then rate        |
|                                     | emotional impact (how negative,        |
|                                     | positive they felt during clip) and    |
|                                     | the degree to which they successfully  |
|                                     | reappraised.                           |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Face recognition: familiar faces    | View faces of famous people (and some  |
|                                     | unknown foils), judge whether each is  |
|                                     | familiar, and if so, what is known     |
|                                     | about the person (occupation,          |
|                                     | nationality, origin of fame, etc.),    |
|                                     | then attempt to provide personâ€™s name. |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Face recognition: unfamiliar faces  | Given a target image of a face,        |
|                                     | identify same individual in an array   |
|                                     | of 6 face images (with possible        |
|                                     | changes in head orientation and        |
|                                     | lighting between target and same face  |
|                                     | in the test array).                    |

|                                     | finger either directly, pressing a     |
|                                     | lever which transmits force to left    |
|                                     | index finger, or indirectly, by moving |
|                                     | a slider which adjusts the force       |
|                                     | transmitted to the left index finger.  |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

|                                     | between tasks; there is not enough     |
|                                     | time to complete any one task.         |
